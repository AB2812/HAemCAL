# HAemCAL
HAemCAL - Haemodynamic Parameter Calculator
HAemCAL is an advanced computational tool designed to calculate essential haemodynamic parameters, playing a crucial role in cardiovascular research, diagnostics, and medical device evaluation. By leveraging computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and in-silico modeling, HAemCAL enables researchers and engineers to assess critical biomechanical factors influencing vascular health and disease progression.

Key Features
HAemCAL computes the following haemodynamic parameters:

Time-Averaged Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS): Measures the average shear stress exerted by blood flow on the endothelial surface over a cardiac cycle.
Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI): Quantifies the change in flow direction, indicating disturbed flow regions associated with atherosclerosis.
Relative Residence Time (RRT): Estimates the duration blood elements remain near the vessel wall, aiding in thrombosis risk assessment.
Endothelial Cell Activation Potential (ECAP): Evaluates the cumulative effect of shear stress on endothelial cells, linked to vascular remodeling.
Haemodynamic Outcome of Lesion-Mediated Endothelial Shear (HOLMES): Assesses shear stress alterations due to vascular lesions, useful in plaque progression studies.
Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR): Calculates the pressure drop across a stenosis to assess the functional significance of coronary artery disease.
Applications
Cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis
Predicting atherosclerosis-prone regions
Optimizing stent and graft designs
Understanding haemodynamic changes in aneurysms and stenotic arteries
Evaluating patient-specific vascular models
HAemCAL is designed for seamless integration with CFD workflows, providing precise, high-fidelity computations for haemodynamic studies. Researchers in cardiovascular biomechanics can utilize this tool for in-depth analysis of blood flow patterns and their impact on vascular health.
